## Basics

### Variables and data types
Variables are containers that hold data values. They are called variables, because they can change according with program execution. They are places in memory that can hold some data.

Example:
```C#
int i;
bool isSomething;
string name;
Employee employee;
```
They can be initialized with values, if not, compiler will put some default value inside it(null to objects, 0 to numbers and false to booleans).
